                <p class="consent-instrution">To conduct this experiment, we need to include this information sheet:</p>
                <div class="form-area">
                    <h1>INFORMATION SHEET for online participants</h1>
                    <p>
                        You are invited to participate in a research study on human cognition, conducted by Hongjing Lu,
                        PhD, of the Dept. of Psychology at UCLA. You were selected as a possible participant in this
                        study because you have normal or corrected vision, and are 18 years of age or older. For
                        scientific reasons, this consent form does not include complete information about the study
                        hypotheses and the research questions being tested. You will be fully debriefed following your
                        participation in the research.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Purpose of Study</h1>
                    <p>The purpose of the study is to understand human perception and cognition.</p>
                    <h1>Procedures Involved in Study</h1>
                    <p>
                        If you agree to participate, you may be presented with images, videos, or sounds on a computer
                        screen, and answer simple questions and/or perform simple tasks by interacting with a website
                        via a keyboard or a computer mouse. You may also be asked to fill out some questionnaires about
                        your personality or experience, which will take at max 15 minutes. Your responses will be
                        recorded by the computer and will not be identified with you in any way. You may receive a
                        demographic questionnaire to collect information of your age, gender, ethnicity, and language.
                        The session will take at most 60 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Potential Risks and Discomforts</h1>
                    <p>
                        There is no known risk/discomfort in this study. If you experience any discomfort during the
                        course of the experiment, you can stop at any time and notify the experimenter.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Potential Benefits to Subject</h1>
                    <p>There are no direct benefits from participating in this study.</p>
                    <h1>Potential Benefits to Society</h1>
                    <p>
                        The findings of the study will help improve procedures for making important decisions to avoid
                        unwanted biases. For example, individual’s cognitive tendencies may influence their decision
                        making on finance, relationships, or diets, and their behaviors in different contexts like
                        internet versus in-person interactions. By understanding how people differ from each other, we
                        will be able to design better environments for people to make rational and just decisions in
                        different domains in life.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Payment for Participation</h1>
                    <p>
                        You would receive 0.5 hour of credit every 30 minute for your psychology class if you signed up
                        for the study through the UCLA Psychology Department Subject Pool; otherwise, you would receive
                        the payment in the rate of $10 per hour for your participation.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Confidentiality</h1>
                    <p>
                        Your identity in this study will be treated as confidential. The results of the study, including
                        laboratory or any other data, may be published for scientific purposes but will not include any
                        identifiable references to you. The researchers will do their best to make sure that your
                        private information is kept confidential. Information about you will be handled as
                        confidentially as possible, but participating in research may involve a loss of privacy and the
                        potential for a breach in confidentiality. Study data will be physically and electronically
                        secured. As with any use of electronic means to store data, there is a risk of breach of data
                        security. Your data, including de-identified data may be kept for use in future research.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your IP Addresses may be collected to prevent the same IP address from participating twice. Your
                        platform ID (e.g., Mturk worker ID, Prolific ID, or Sona ID) will not be shared with anyone
                        outside of the research team and will not be linked to study responses. However, any work
                        performed on MTurk can be linked to the user’s public profile page. Thus, you may wish to
                        restrict what information you choose to share in your public profile.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Your participation is VOLUNTARY. You may withdraw from the experiment at any time without
                        suffering any negative consequences.

                    We are a bunch of scientists exploring human aesthetic experiences and their relationship with the
                    format of mental representations. In particular, this study looks into a phenomenon called the
                    prototype preference, where people find typical members of a category more visually pleasing than
                    atypical members of the same category.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recently, an alternative explanation was proposed that made a unique prediction: Human prefers
                    typical members because their representative features allow us to access category-related
                    information easier. At the same time, most of the categories in the world that we frequently
                    interact with and tested in the experiments are positive or at least neutral. Thus, the typicality
                    of a category member facilitate access to more positive information. This idea makes an unusual
                    prediction: The prototype preference should end up being the prototype aversion when a negative
                    category is under consideration instead!
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is what we are testing here with all those insects, guns, and snakes that are usually
                    considered negative. We will find out soon if people indeed dislike typical insects, guns, or snakes
                    more than atypical ones.

                <h1>Here's some additional information about the broader project this study is associated with:</h1>
                <p>
                    We are studying human cognition by looking at how people differ in terms of personality, cognitive
                    tendencies, and skills. Here are a few example scientific questions we are looking at:
                </p>
                <p>Do people agree what looks pretty and what looks bad?</p>
                <p>How is one’s personality related to their judgement of social situations?</p>
                <p>Would cultural backgrounds influence memory of different objects?</p>
                <p>
